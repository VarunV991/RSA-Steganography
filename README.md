# RSA-Steganography

LSB-Steganography is a steganography technique in which we hide messages inside an image by replacing Least significant bit of image with the bits of message to be hidden.  

In this project, I have used RSA encryption to encrypt the message first and then hide the encryted message using LSB Stegnography.

RSA encryption provides an extra layer of security to hidden data.
